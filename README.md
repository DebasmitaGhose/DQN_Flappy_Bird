##### Dependencies:
* Python 3.6.5
* Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

##### How to run:
* Run `python dqn.py test` to run pretrained neural network model.
* Run `python dqn.py train` to train the model from the beginning. You can also increase FPS in game/flappy_bird.py script for faster training.
